# heads-up
"Heads Up!" was originally an app prototype developed as part of CPEN 441 which is an HCI design course.

It is a reminders app that hopes to eliminate the problem of cramming by providing students with automatic reminders of upcoming tasks at appropriate times before the deadline.

While the practical application of this concept was not proven, I implemented the app in React Native as part of my exploration in mobile development.
